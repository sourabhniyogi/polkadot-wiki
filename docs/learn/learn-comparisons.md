## Rollup Comparison

**Rollups** are an L2 scaling solution. At the most basic level, a rollup L2 solution is responsible
for "rolling up" transactions by batching them before publishing them to the L1 chain, usually
through a network of **sequencers**. This mechanism could include thousands of transactions in a
single rollup.

:::info Layer Two Definition

Layer two (L2) networks are popular as being the way forward for blockchain scalability by
off-loading the majority of computation from layer one (L1) networks. L2 solutions utilize the L1
network's security and functionality to build an additional layer that is often faster, reduces
fees, and solves other platform-specific issues. In many cases, L2 solutions focus on utilizing L1
blockspace efficiently and cost-effectively.

In this section we explore the main differences in rollup technology between:

- Zero-knowledge rollups,
- Optimistic rollups, and
- Polkadot rollups (i.e. parachains).

Before diving into the differences between these rollup technologies, it is important to understand
the difference between non-interactive and interactive methods.

### Non-interactive vs. Interactive Rollup Methods

In the context of rollups, **interactive** and **non-interactive** methods refer to how the validity
of transactions or state changes is established between the rollup layer and the main blockchain
(L1).

A non-interactive method relies on cryptographic proofs to validate transactions or state changes without requiring dispute resolution or interactive challenges. A prominent example is zero-knowledge proving mechanisms that operate off-chain, such as a zk-SNARK or zk-STARK. These protocols prove that the transactions in a batch satisfy the rules of the protocol. These proofs are submitted to the L1 chain
and verified without needing further interaction.
An interactive method involves a back-and-forth process between parties to validate transactions. A
prominent example is the usage of fraud proofs, as used in optimistic rollups. If a dispute arises, a challenge
mechanism is triggered, where a "prover" submits evidence (fraud proof) to demonstrate that a
transaction is invalid. This can require multiple steps, with both the challenger and defender
submitting data to the L1 chain.

Here below, the key differences between interactive and non-interactive methods.

| **Aspect**         | **Interactive**                                 | **Non-Interactive**                                                     |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mechanism**      | Back-and-forth dispute resolution.              | One-time proof submission and verification.                             |
| **Latency**        | Long finality due to challenge periods.         | Near-instant finality.                                                  |
| **Security Basis** | Economic incentives and monitoring.             | Cryptographic guarantees.                                               |
| **Complexity**     | Simpler to implement but requires monitoring.   | Computationally intensive and harder to build.                          |
| **Use Cases**      | Broad compatibility with existing applications. | Best for high-security applications where instant finality is critical. |

Both approaches serve different needs and trade-offs, depending on the balance between scalability,
security, latency, and flexibility required.

### Zero-knowledge Rollups

Zero-knowledge rollups (often called ZK rollups) are a _non-interactive_ method that utilizes
zero-knowledge proofs to compute the validity of a particular set of state changes. Whereas
optimistic rollups relied on fraud proofs, ZK rollups rely on cryptographic validation in the form
of ZK proofs.

Zero-knowledge rollups are significantly faster in finalization, as the cryptographic validity proof
handles the nuance of ensuring a rollup is valid. However, the ZK rollups often suffer from a
performance perspective due to the complexity involved in proof generation and difficult implementation into resource-constrained environments. Because Turing completeness is also challenging to achieve due to this computational
overhead, their ability to be generalized (in terms of blockspace) is reduced. However, they have a
promising future in solving some of the problems of optimistic rollups and addressing secure
scalability.

### Optimistic Rollups

Optimistic rollups are an interactive scaling method for L1 blockchains. They assume
_optimistically_ that every proposed transaction is valid by default.

In the case of mitigating potentially invalid transactions, optimistic rollups introduce a
_challenge period_ during which participants may challenge a suspect rollup. A fraud-proving scheme
can be in place to allow for several _fraud proofs_ to be submitted. Those proofs could make the
rollup valid or invalid. During the challenge period, state changes may be disputed, resolved, or
included if no challenge is presented (and the required proofs are in place).

Optimistic rollups are often used in the Ethereum ecosystem. [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/)
and [Arbitrium](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/) are optimistic EVM-based rollup.

### Polkadot Rollups

Polkadot implements this functionality at the native level (i.e. without using L2 scaling
solutions), allowing for shared security and scalability of the relay chain and respective
parachains. Shared security is a concept that has similar goals to EVM-based optimistic and
zero-knowledge rollups. Still, instead of being implemented as a secondary layer, Polkadot
guarantees native security and scalability for each of its parachains through the
[Parachains Protocol](./learn-parachains-protocol.md). Polkadot handles the coordination of data
from parachains into an aggregated, representative state, somewhat similar to L2 rollups.

Whereas rollups are considered solutions for L2 protocols, Polkadot include this functionality
natively through its [Parachains Protocol](./learn-parachains-protocol.md). The Parachains Protocol,
which is how Polkadot handles network's **sharding** is meant to accomplish the combined goals of
providing security, scalability, and availability.

It enables parachains to verify their collective state and communicate with one another. Parachains
have similarities to aspects of optimistic and ZK rollups, which are reflected in how Polkadot
handles the validity and availability of the parachain state. [Collators](./learn-collator.md), a
key part of Polkadot architecture, are in principle similar to sequencers, as collators pass data
with a proof-of-validity (PoV) function for liveness and communication with the relay chain.

Each shard, or parachain, is equipped with a unique state transition function (STF). This function
ensures that communication to the relay chain remains valid. Each STF, called runtime, is written in
[Wasm](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-wasm). Any state transition function is valid if it
compiles to Wasm and abides by the Parachains Protocol.

Each STF runs a validity proof. The proof ([the Approval Protocol](./learn-parachains-protocol.md))
is interactive, unlike ZK rollups, which are non-interactive. Additionally, unlike ZK rollups, there
are no difficulties in creating parachains with Turing-complete logic. Each parachain is also a
full-fledged state machine (usually in the form of a blockchain). Similarly to optimistic rollups,
the Parachain Protocol also has cases where disputes and resolutions of potentially harmful para
blocks (blocks representing the parachain) can take place, in which case the validators that vouched
for that parablock are [slashed](./learn-offenses.md) if it is found to be bad.

| **Finality**                 | Near-instant finality. Because the proof is immediately available, finality is also instantaneous.             | Delayed finality (a week) due to fraud-proof mechanisms.                                                                                                                     | Fast finality (under 1 minute) via the relay chain's consensus mechanism.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Security Model**           | Relies on cryptographic validity proofs, ensuring high security and no reliance on game-theoretic assumptions. | Relies on economic incentives and a challenge period to catch fraud. Optimistic assumption makes it less secure than ZK Rollups.                                             | Shared security is native, leveraging Polkadot's validator set and erasure coding for data availability. Strong Byzantine fault tolerance. No optimistic assumption, rollup data are checked all the time. Secondary checks and an escalation process give strong security guarantees and minimize chance of malicious block finalization. |
| **Scalability**              | Limited by computational expense and challenges in building generalized ZK circuits.                           | Constrained by gas limitations in parent chains like Ethereum.                                                                                                               | Inherently scalable through native sharding and parachains operating in parallel. [Pipelining](./learn-async-backing.md) and [core scheduling](./learn-agile-coretime.md) increase throughput and scalability for the single rollup.                                                                                                       |
| **Decentralization**         | Risk of centralization in sequencer roles and ZK proof computation.                                            | Sequencer centralization concerns, as validators are known and fewer in number.                                                                                              | Collator set decentralization is critical; fully centralized collators reduce the benefits, making parachains similar to other rollup technologies.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Interoperability**         | Limited to networks with compatible smart contract support.                                                    | Limited interoperability, often confined to the parent blockchain ecosystem. See the [comparison about interoperability](#interoperability-comparison) for more information. | Native interoperability through [XCM](./learn-xcm.md), allowing seamless communication between parachains having different logic.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Development Complexity**   | Difficult to implement and optimize due to the complexity of ZK proof systems.                                 | Simpler to implement but requires careful fraud-proof logic.                                                                                                                 | Moderate; any runtime compiled to Wasm is valid, simplifying parachain development.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Feature                     | Polkadot XCM                                                                                       | Optimism Superchain Interoperability                                                    | Chainlink CCIP                                                                           |

| **Architecture**            | Direct communication between parachains within the Polkadot ecosystem using a unified relay chain. | Cross-rollup interoperability built on Ethereum, extending rollups’ compatibility.      | Universal standard enabling cross-chain communication for any blockchain network.        |
| **Scope**                   | Limited to parachains and relay chains in the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem.                           | Focused on rollups in Ethereum Layer 2 (e.g., Optimism, Base).                          | Blockchain-agnostic, supporting public and private chains.                               |
| **Consensus Dependency**    | Relies on Polkadot's shared relay chain consensus.                                                 | Depends on Ethereum Layer 1 for security and sequencer trust within Superchain rollups. | Independent of any specific chain’s consensus, uses oracle network for secure messaging. |
| **Interoperability Model**  | Messages are trustlessly passed between parachains using XCMP and HRMP channels.                   | Rollups communicate through the Superchain’s sequencer infrastructure.                  | Relies on Chainlink decentralized oracles to transmit data securely across chains.       |
| **Scalability**             | High scalability within the ecosystem; limited by relay chain capacity.                            | Limited by Ethereum throughput and Superchain architecture.                             | Scalable; offloads cross-chain messaging to oracle networks.                             |
| **Security Model**          | Secured by Polkadot's relay validators and stake.                                                  | Secured by Ethereum’s base layer and rollup-specific fraud or validity proofs.          | Security ensured by Chainlink oracles and cryptographic proofs.                          |
| **Ease of Integration**     | Requires Substrate-based parachains and compliance with Polkadot protocols.                        | Requires rollups to align with Optimism’s OP stack architecture.                        | Blockchain-agnostic, integrates with any chain using CCIP libraries.                     |
| **Interoperability Speed**  | Near-instant, as Polkadot’s shared relay chain validates interactions.                             | Relatively slower due to dependency on Layer 1 Ethereum finality and rollup delays.     | Fast, as it relies on Chainlink oracle nodes for data transmission.                      |
| **Use Cases**               | Native token transfers, contract execution, shared staking pools.                                  | Bridging assets and state between rollups.                                              | Cross-chain DeFi, gaming, enterprise blockchain communication.                           |
| **Prone to Centralization** | Low; Polkadot's design enforces decentralization.                                                  | Medium; rollup sequencers could centralize without proper safeguards.                   | Medium; depends on the decentralization level of Chainlink's oracle network.             |
| **Current Deployment**      | Actively deployed in Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems.                                               | Early stage; foundational elements are live, expanding with OP stack rollups.           | Widely adopted across multiple chains in both testnet and mainnet.                       |
| **Key Strengths**           | Seamless, low-latency native communication within the ecosystem.                                   | Interoperability focused on Ethereum scalability and Layer 2 adoption.                  | Universal, chain-agnostic standard with flexible use cases.                              |
| **Limitations**             | Limited to Polkadot-compatible parachains.                                                         | Restricted to Ethereum and rollups using OP stack.                                      | Depends on oracle network security and adoption rate.                                    |
