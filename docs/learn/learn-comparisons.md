## Rollup Comparison

**Rollups** are an L2 scaling solution. At the most basic level, a rollup L2 solution is responsible
for "rolling up" transactions by batching them before publishing them to the L1 chain, usually
through a network of **sequencers**. This mechanism could include thousands of transactions in a
single rollup.

:::info Layer Two Definition

Layer two (L2) networks are popular as being the way forward for blockchain scalability by
off-loading the majority of computation from layer one (L1) networks. L2 solutions utilize the L1
network's security and functionality to build an additional layer that is often faster, reduces
fees, and solves other platform-specific issues. In many cases, L2 solutions focus on utilizing L1
blockspace efficiently and cost-effectively.

In this section we explore the main differences in rollup technology between:

- Zero-knowledge rollups,
- Optimistic rollups, and
- Polkadot rollups (i.e. parachains).

Before diving into the differences between these rollup technologies, it is important to understand
the difference between non-interactive and interactive methods.

### Non-interactive vs. Interactive Rollup Methods

In the context of rollups, **interactive** and **non-interactive** methods refer to how the validity
of transactions or state changes is established between the rollup layer and the main blockchain
(L1).

A non-interactive method relies on cryptographic proofs to validate transactions or state changes
without requiring dispute resolution or interactive challenges. A prominent example is
zero-knowledge proving mechanisms that operate off-chain, such as a zk-SNARK or zk-STARK. These
protocols prove that the transactions in a batch satisfy the rules of the protocol. These proofs are
submitted to the L1 chain and verified without needing further interaction.

An interactive method involves a back-and-forth process between parties to validate transactions. A
prominent example is the usage of fraud proofs, as used in optimistic rollups. If a dispute arises,
a challenge mechanism is triggered, where a "prover" submits evidence (fraud proof) to demonstrate
that a transaction is invalid. This can require multiple steps, with both the challenger and
defender submitting data to the L1 chain.

Here below, the key differences between interactive and non-interactive methods.

| **Aspect**         | **Interactive**                                 | **Non-Interactive**                                                     |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mechanism**      | Back-and-forth dispute resolution.              | One-time proof submission and verification.                             |
| **Latency**        | Long finality due to challenge periods.         | Near-instant finality.                                                  |
| **Security Basis** | Economic incentives and monitoring.             | Cryptographic guarantees.                                               |
| **Complexity**     | Simpler to implement but requires monitoring.   | Computationally intensive and harder to build.                          |
| **Use Cases**      | Broad compatibility with existing applications. | Best for high-security applications where instant finality is critical. |

Both approaches serve different needs and trade-offs, depending on the balance between scalability,
security, latency, and flexibility required.

### Zero-knowledge Rollups

Zero-knowledge rollups (often called ZK rollups) are a _non-interactive_ method that utilizes
zero-knowledge proofs to compute the validity of a particular set of state changes. Whereas
[optimistic rollups](#optimistic-rollups) rely on fraud proofs, ZK rollups rely on cryptographic
validation in the form of ZK proofs.

Zero-knowledge rollups are significantly faster in finalization, as the cryptographic validity proof
handles the nuance of ensuring a rollup is valid. However, the ZK rollups often suffer from a
performance perspective due to the complexity involved in proof generation and difficult
implementation into resource-constrained environments. Because Turing completeness is also
challenging to achieve due to this computational overhead, their ability to be generalized (in terms
of blockspace) is reduced. However, the generation of zk proofs is becoming useful in niche
applications. For example, [Hyperbridge](./learn-bridges.md#bridge-comparison) is a ZK rollup on
Polkadot that serves as a scalable trustless bridge producing a single zk proof for multiple
blockchains that can be instantly verified on Polkadot.

### Optimistic Rollups

Optimistic rollups are an interactive scaling method for L1 blockchains. They assume
_optimistically_ that every proposed transaction is valid by default.

In the case of mitigating potentially invalid transactions, optimistic rollups introduce a
_challenge period_ during which participants may challenge a suspect rollup. A fraud-proving scheme
can be in place to allow for several _fraud proofs_ to be submitted. Those proofs could make the
rollup valid or invalid. During the challenge period, state changes may be disputed, resolved, or
included if no challenge is presented (and the required proofs are in place).

Optimistic rollups are often used in the Ethereum ecosystem. [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/)
and [Arbitrium](https://bridge.arbitrum.io/) are an example of optimistic EVM-based rollups.

### Polkadot Rollups

Polkadot Rollups work similarly to optimistic rollups. They are an interactive method with fraud
proof mechanism. Very much like optimistic rollups and zk rollups are secured by Ethereum, Polkadot
rollups are secured by the Polkadot Relay Chain. The checking and fraud proof mechanics are
implemented on Polkadot, natively. [collators](./learn-collator.md), are in principle similar to
sequencers, as they pass data with a proof-of-validity (PoV) function for liveness and communication
with the Relay Chain.

However, Polkadot rollups have the following main differences compared to optimistic rollups:

- Polkadot rollups can be fully-fledged state machine (usually in the form of a blockchain) with own
  logic, governance mechanism, etc.
- Polkadot implements rollup functionality at the native level (i.e. without using L2 scaling
  solutions), allowing for shared security and scalability for each rollup through the
  [Parachains Protocol](./learn-parachains-protocol.md). Polkadot handles the coordination of data
  from parachains into an aggregated, representative state, somewhat similar to L2 rollups.
- Each shard, or parachain, can be equipped with a unique state transition function (STF). This
  function ensures that communication to the relay chain remains valid. Each STF, called runtime, is
  compiled to [Wasm](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-wasm). Any STF is valid if it compiles
  to Wasm and abides by the Parachains Protocol.
- If optimistc rollups are based on the assumption that all transactions a valid, **Polkadot rollups
  are "cynical" and always check the validity of transactions using a subset of the validators**. In
  case of disputes, an escalation effect involving more validators is triggered and dispute
  resolution will end with the malicious actor being [slashed](./learn-offenses.md).
- Polkadot has multiple virtual cores that are made possible thanks to the Parachain Protocol
  allowing execution sharding. Rollups access Polkadot by reserving time on those cores via
  [coretime](./learn-agile-coretime.md).

A more detailed comparison of Polkadot rollups with optimistic and zk rollups can be found in the
comparison table below.

| **Security Model**           | Relies on cryptographic validity proofs, ensuring high security and no reliance on game-theoretic assumptions. | Relies on economic incentives and a challenge period to catch fraud.

## Interoperability Comparison

In this section we explore the main differences in interoperability between Polkadot,
[Optimism Superchain Ecosystem](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/explainer) and
[Chainlink CCIP (Cross-chain Interoperability Protocol)](https://chain.link/cross-chain).

| Feature                     | Polkadot XCM                                                                                       | Optimism Superchain Interoperability                                                    | Chainlink CCIP                                                                           |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Architecture**            | Direct communication between parachains within the Polkadot ecosystem using a unified relay chain. | Cross-rollup interoperability built on Ethereum, extending rollups’ compatibility.      | Universal standard enabling cross-chain communication for any blockchain network.        |
| **Scope**                   | Limited to parachains and relay chains in the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem.                           | Focused on rollups in Ethereum Layer 2 (e.g., Optimism, Base).                          | Blockchain-agnostic, supporting public and private chains.                               |
| **Consensus Dependency**    | Relies on Polkadot's shared relay chain consensus.                                                 | Depends on Ethereum Layer 1 for security and sequencer trust within Superchain rollups. | Independent of any specific chain’s consensus, uses oracle network for secure messaging. |
| **Interoperability Model**  | Messages are trustlessly passed between parachains using XCMP and HRMP channels.                   | Rollups communicate through the Superchain’s sequencer infrastructure.                  | Relies on Chainlink decentralized oracles to transmit data securely across chains.       |
| **Scalability**             | High scalability within the ecosystem; limited by relay chain capacity.                            | Limited by Ethereum throughput and Superchain architecture.                             | Scalable; offloads cross-chain messaging to oracle networks.                             |
| **Security Model**          | Secured by Polkadot's relay validators and stake.                                                  | Secured by Ethereum’s base layer and rollup-specific fraud or validity proofs.          | Security ensured by Chainlink oracles and cryptographic proofs.                          |
| **Ease of Integration**     | Requires Substrate-based parachains and compliance with Polkadot protocols.                        | Requires rollups to align with Optimism’s OP stack architecture.                        | Blockchain-agnostic, integrates with any chain using CCIP libraries.                     |
| **Interoperability Speed**  | Near-instant, as Polkadot’s shared relay chain validates interactions.                             | Relatively slower due to dependency on Layer 1 Ethereum finality and rollup delays.     | Fast, as it relies on Chainlink oracle nodes for data transmission.                      |
| **Use Cases**               | Native token transfers, contract execution, shared staking pools.                                  | Bridging assets and state between rollups.                                              | Cross-chain DeFi, gaming, enterprise blockchain communication.                           |
| **Prone to Centralization** | Low; Polkadot's design enforces decentralization.                                                  | Medium; rollup sequencers could centralize without proper safeguards.                   | Medium; depends on the decentralization level of Chainlink's oracle network.             |
| **Current Deployment**      | Actively deployed in Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems.                                               | Early stage; foundational elements are live, expanding with OP stack rollups.           | Widely adopted across multiple chains in both testnet and mainnet.                       |
| **Key Strengths**           | Seamless, low-latency native communication within the ecosystem.                                   | Interoperability focused on Ethereum scalability and Layer 2 adoption.                  | Universal, chain-agnostic standard with flexible use cases.                              |
| **Limitations**             | Limited to Polkadot-compatible parachains.                                                         | Restricted to Ethereum and rollups using OP stack.                                      | Depends on oracle network security and adoption rate.                                    |
